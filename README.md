# Fake Store API E-commerce Application

## FakeStoreApi is a fake Store API that you can be used with any type of shopping project that needs products, carts, and users in JSON format. However, you do not need any serve-side code to run the application, so it is easy to use via end the points you get in the Docs of the main page. Creating a fully-functional front-end application from scratch or use this starter for front-end.Links to an external site.

## E-Commerce App Requirements Tier 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

# AS A USER (NOT LOGGED IN), I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:

# Access the website via the internet so I can browse and purchase products. (Deployed on a front end host)

# View all available products.

# View the details for an individual product, including product descriptions, photos, price, etc.

# Sort products by certain characteristics (name, price, etc.).

# Filter products by certain characteristics (category, type, maximum/minimum price, etc.).

# Enjoy an aesthetically pleasing website with intuitive and easy to use UI/UX

## Tech Stack

# Frontend:

# Vite and React.js: For building UI components

# React Router: For handling routes & navigation

# Bootstrap & React Bootstrap: For responsive styling & layout

# TailwindCSS: For CSS inline layout

## Challenges

# Authentication Endpoint Path: There is an additional field provided by the API, isAuthor, which is only valid for posts made by the user represented by the authentication token. I had to make sure to use the data that they have registered by id for posts based on whether or not the current user is the author. Then, I had to use the users' passwords and username data they have available in the Fake Store API to authenticate them.
